            <br>My army service included two years as a combat soldier in various places in Israel.<br>
            An additional year in the

    <h4>Personal life</h4>
    <p class="mapZone">
        I was born in Kibbutz Gat, a small place about an hour south of Tel Aviv.<br>
        In my free time I enjoy traveling outdoors, reading, and scenery photography.<br>
        I believe programing is right for me because it envolves problem solving and creativity, two fields that are important to me, and that I'm good at.<br>
        I also believe it is the best opportunity for me to take action in the world I live in, and impact it.
        <br><br>Places I have lived include:
        <ul>
            <li>Kibbutz Gat - 24 years</li>
            <li>Rishon Le-Tziyon - 1 year</li>
            <li>Berlin - 3 years</li>
        </ul>
